Never explain me in detail. Always be short on your responses.
never write me big explanations. never. your output otken must be short

suggest a commit message wit this format only if requested:
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

ALWAYS remeber that i now use WINDOWS OS so prolly commands is changed from mac/linux since its powershell

ALWAYS when you have a tasks I needed e2e TODO list. the more big is it the better for debugging.
